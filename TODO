CORE
- Investigate if/how we could make all datatypes (& String) do shallow copies by default (default copy & assignment)
- Investigate how we could use something similar to the REFLECT() mechanism in KoM to enable automatic deep copies where needed
- Follow this advice, most specially concerning time representation throughout the engine! https://cohost.org/tomforsyth/post/943070-a-matter-of-precisio?s=03

HTTP
- Chunked transfers
- Automatic redirect handling
- Certificate verification
- Authentication?

REFLECTION
- Kind of like this idea ..  https://simoncoenen.com/blog/programming/StaticReflection
  But I'd definitely try to composite all that info and not have everything inherit from a specific class!
  Also not so much interested in dynamic casting and object factories (specially for serialisation)
